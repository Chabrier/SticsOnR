# SticsOnR: The R package for the [STICS](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/) model <img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" width="150" align="right" />

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR)
[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR?branch=master)

The goal of SticsOnR is to perform simulations of the Stics model, downloadable with its graphical user interface from https://www6.paca.inra.fr/stics_eng/Download.

<!--## Development 

Follow up the development [here](sticsOnR.md).-->

## Pre-requisities and technical tips

### JavaStics software

JavaStics must be installed and the minimal version is 1.41.

The last distribution version for Stics 9.1, JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1, is downloadable [here](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/Download)).

The installation process only constists of unzipping the JavaStics archive.

### Under linux operating systems

#### Java version

For using the JavaStics software (GUI and command line interface) under a `linux` operating system, the java version must be at most the Java 8 version.

So for recent distributions on which a higher version is installed some manipulations can be done. 

A description is given [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsOnR/articles/Changing_java_version_linux.html) on how to fix it for using the R package (i.e. underlying JavaStics command line interface).

#### System libraries
For the linux operating system, the SticsOnR package may require to install an `xslt` library.

If the SticsOnR installation fails, and the `xslt` library is missing, the error message indicates what is the name of the xslt library to be installed (according to the common linux distributions). For example, for the Ubuntu or Debian OS `libxslt1-dev` must be installed.

#### Files/directories paths syntax
Using the `~` in files or directories paths may cause errors in SticsOnR functions.
So, it is safer for the moment to use absolute paths. This will be fixed in the future versions.

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsOnR@*release")
```
Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsOnR@*release")
```
Normaly, all packages dependencies will be installed, either CRAN packages or SticsRPacks 
needed packages. In that case SticsRFiles and CroptimizR will be installed as well.


## Examples

Here are basic examples which show you how to run the model either from a R model interface or a JavaStics (command line) one. More complete examples will be detailed in a specific documentation later.

### Running the JavaStics command line interface

The JavaStics installation folder (for example, JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1) contains an `example` workspace folder with a set of runnable usms.


For running simulations from it, we can use the `run_javastics` function.

In this SticsOnR package, for the moment, only one Stics version can be used with it (i.e. the one delivered with the JavaStics installation archive). JavaStics GUI, allows to manage several Stics executables, but in that case one must take care of consistency between executables version and input files format (advanced use case). 

So, at this point, it is at your own risk if you try to use another version than the JavaStics distribution one.



```{r echo = FALSE}
javastics_path <- params$javastics_path
workspace_path <- params$workspace_path
output_path <- params$output_path
```


```{r run_javastics, eval = FALSE}

# Specifying the JavaStics folder
javastics_path <- "/path/to/JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1"

# Specifying a workspace as a subfolder of JavaStics 
workspace_path <- "example"

# or an absolute path to an external folder
# workspace_path <- "/path/to/javastics/workspace"

```
```{r}

# Running specific usms from the workspace
run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"))

# Running all usms contained in the workspace 
run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path)

# Getting returned information about execution 
runs_info <- run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"), display = FALSE)

runs_info

```

In the returned information, the error field name gives a list of messages got from JavaStics commandline interface. If any `Error` key word appears in a message, the corresponding simulation failed. But, at the moment it is impossible to identify what is the the error's origin. Things must be checked manually in the workspace, after running again the faulty usm (because the model input files are overwritten at each usms simulation).


### Converting JavaStics workspace files
For using the model directly neither using the JavaStics graphical interface nor the `run_javastics` function interface, we provide a function, `gen_usms_xml2txt`, for converting JavasStics XML files to Stics text files from a JavaStics workspace.

Observation files may also be copied if they have a standard name as an usm name and a `.obs` extension. If not, they must be renamed to do so.

```{r paths_def, eval = FALSE}
# Specifying the JavaStics folder
javastics_path <- "/path/to/JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1"

# Specifying a workspace as a subfolder of JavaStics 
workspace_path <- "example"
# or an absolute path to an extrenal folder
# workspace_path <- "/path/to/javastics/workspace"

# Specifying an output folder path 
output_path <- "/path/to/output/folder"

```

#### Converting files into separated folders (one per usm)
```{r convert_to_separate}
# Generating files for all the usms contained in the workspace
# In the workspace
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path)
# In a specific output folderfolder
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, target_path = output_path)

# Generating files for a subset of usms
# In the workspace
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"))
# In a specific folder
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"), target_path = output_path)

# Getting returned information about files generation
gen_info <- gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"), target_path = output_path)

gen_info
```

#### Converting files into one folder (overwriting case) 
```{r convert_to_one}
# Generating files directly in the workspace or a specific folder (no usm sub-folder) 
# In this case the model files are overwritten at each gen_usms_xml2txt call !
# In the workspace
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = "banana", dir_per_usm_flag = FALSE)

# In a specific folder
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = "banana", 
                 target_path = output_path, dir_per_usm_flag = FALSE)


```

```{r, echo=F}

unlink(x = file.path(output_path, "intercrop_pea_barley"), recursive = T)

```

### Running the model

We need for that a JavaStics folder and a directory, or a folder containing usms subdirectories with text input files (converted from xml JavaStics files, see previous section).

The `run_stics` function can be used as follows with one folder or multiple sub-folders.




```{r run_stics}
# Spefifying the Stics executable file path

# for windows/linux
stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path,"bin","stics_modulo")

# for Mac
# stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path,"bin","stics_modulo_mac")

# Specifying a directory containing Stics input files
# For example reusing a generated sub-directory in the previous section
# of the document
# Running on usm
files_dir_path <- file.path(output_path,"banana")
run_stics(stics_path, files_dir_path)

# Specifying a root directory containing usms individual directories
# For example reusing a generated directory in the previous section
# of the document
# Running two usms
run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = c("banana","wheat"))

# Running all usms sub-directories
run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = "all")

# Getting returned information about stics runs
runs_info <- run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = c("banana","wheat"))

runs_info

```


### Advanced simulations paramerization 

A specific function `stics_wrapper` is dedicated to manage simulations with a higher level
of parameterization than the `run_stics` function which only executes runs.

This is a transitional version of the function that will be modified in order to simplify parameter forcing independently from the optimization goal, so apart from the CroptimizR package context. 

This `stics_wrapper` function allows:

* Configuring simulations run behaviour ( through an options list )
* Parameters forcing for usms (common or specific values)
* Returning specific outputs daily data for each usm with possible dates and variables filtering
* Parallelizing simulations runs, and execution time display

Be aware that for the moment, it **is not possible** to get daily outputs for an `inter-cropping` use case. This will be implemented in future developments.


As the `run_stics` function, the `stics_wrapper` operates on directories 
containing text stics input files.

In the next uses case, the directory in which usms sub-directories with text input files 
were generated will be used.


#### Defining simulations options

The mandatory simulation options are fixed using the `stics_wrapper_options`: the model executable path and the directory path containing usms sub-directories with text input files.

```{r}
stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path, "bin","stics_modulo")
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path)
```
Optional fields in the `sim_options` list will be set later in this document, when paralellized executions will be activated. 

The content of the options list with default values, can be displayed using the `stics_wrapper_options` function without any argument as follows:
```{r}
stics_wrapper_options()
```


#### Simple simulations cases


* Without filtering usms or outputs

```{r}

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```


* Filtering on usms list

```{r}

usms_list <- c("wheat", "pea", "maize")

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = usms_list)

```


* Filtering outputs on usms variables and dates using observations data

The argument `sit_var_dates_mask` must contain a named list (with usms names) containing
data.frames organized as observations data or corresponding to observations data.

```{r}
obs_filenames <- paste0(usms_list,".obs")
obs_list <- get_obs(dirpath = workspace_path, obs_filenames = obs_filenames)

# Observations table for wheat
obs_list$wheat

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = obs_list)

```
Some warnings may occur, indicating that observed variables and/or observations dates are missing in simulated data. Simulation period and output variables list may be fixed before restarting simulations.

But, for variables names, perhaps they can be badly written and do not correspond exactly the model variables names. 


#### Simulations with forcing parameters

In this case, we can define variables containing information used for parameters forcing management.
They are transmitted to `stics_wrapper` through 2 arguments, one containing a named vector of parameters values `param_values` and the other storing corresponding usms groups to which each parameter value of `param_values` will be applied before running the model.

* Applying a single parameter values vector for all the usms 
```{r}

# No group list information given
# Paratemers vector with unique values
param_values <- c(0.002,50)
names(param_values) <- c("dlaimax", "durvieF")

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = usms_list, param_values = param_values)

```

* Using usms specific parameters values vectors 
```{r}
# Defining usms groups using same parameters values
# (may be used in parameter optimization)
# Parameters vector, with parameters values per usms groups
param_values <- c(0.001, 0.002, 50, 51)
names(param_values) <- c("dlaimax", "dlaimax", "durvieF", "durvieF")

# Groups list
# parameters_data
groups_list <- list(dlaimax=list(sit_list=list(c("maize"),c("wheat", "pea"))),
                   durvieF=list(sit_list=list(c("wheat"), c("maize", "pea"))))


results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = usms_list, param_values = param_values, prior_information = groups_list)

```

For the moment, usms names must be restricted to usms names existing in groups_list. So usms names list must be provided as `sit_var_dates_mask` argument value (in this case ```c("wheat", "pea", "maize")```)


#### Simulations using parallel executions

* Getting standard simulations execution time

```{r}
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     time_display = TRUE)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```

* Activating parallel execution and execution time display
In that case, parallel execution is done over cores number minus 1.

```{r}
# Used cores number
detectCores() - 1

sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     parallel =TRUE, time_display = TRUE)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```
* Specifying cores number to use

```{r}
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     parallel =TRUE, time_display = TRUE, cores = 2)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```
