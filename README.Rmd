## Overview

This package allows the user to programmatically: 

* read ([`read_param`](R/read_param.R)) or set ([`set_param`](R/read_param.R)) parameters  

* set ([`set_usm`](R/set_usm.R)) one or more simulations (USM)

* call STICS to run them ([`run_stics`](R/run_stics.R))

* import the results for analyses ([`read_output`](R/read_output.R)), or the observations available in the USM ([`read_obs`](R/read_obs.R))

* compare observations and simulations ([`eval_output`](R/eval_output.R))

* make all previous at once in parallel for comparison between STICS versions ([`stics_eval`](R/stics_eval.R))

* generate automatic reports (only available for one experiment, development terminated but still under evaluation)

* and run sensitivity analyses ([`sensitive_stics`](R/sensitive_stics.R)) for one or more input parameters (and their possible interactions) effect on one or more output variables

The package is under intensive development, so you can fill an issue or request me a feature [here](https://github.com/VEZY/sticRs/issues ) at any time. 

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("VEZY/sticRs")
```
Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("VEZY/sticRs")
```
For the moment, there is no [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) release of sticRs, but we work on that.
You will soon be able to run this command to install the package:

``` r
install.packages("sticRs")
```

## Examples

### Setting a parameter and running the model

This is a basic example using the default dummy simulation (parameters and meteorology) for a mixed crop of wheat-wheat (not a real mixed crop, for testing the model behavior) :

```{r example1, eval=FALSE}
library("sticRs")
set_usm(plant= c("wheat","wheat"))
# Reading the interrang parameter:
read_param(param='interrang')
# Setting the interrang parameter to 0.01 meter:
set_param(param= "interrang", value= 0.01)
# Running the model:
run_stics(dirpath = "Your_path_goes_here")
```

To use your own data, simply use the folder of your simulation as the reference path; like you would do with javaSTICS.

### Making a sensitivity analysis

Make a sensitivity analysis using the `fast99` algorithm for the interrow (`interrang` parameter) for three main variables: the intercepted radiation (`raint`), the leaf area index (`lai(n)`), and the dry mass (`masec(n)`):
```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
library("sticRs")
sens= sensitive_stics(dir.orig = "0-DATA/dummy/SC_Wheat",
                      dir.targ = "2-Simulations/Sensitivity2",
                      stics = "0-DATA/stics_executable/EquDens_trg/stics.exe",
                      obs_name = "Wheat_N0.obs",Parameters = "interrang",
                      Vars = c("raint", "lai(n)", "masec(n)"),
                      method= "fast99", n= 10,
                      q= "qunif",q.arg = list(list(min=0.05, max=0.25),
                                              list(min=140, max=280)))
```
NB: `n`, `q`, and `q.arg` are parameters from the [`fast99`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensitivity/sensitivity.pdf) function.

The output from [`sensitive_stics`](R/sensitive_stics.R) is a list of two:  

* A list of ggplot objects to plot the sensitivity of each variable to the parameter(s) along the rotation

* A list of the output from the method function, *e.g.* a list of class `fast99` for the `fast99` method.


## Acknowledgments

The STICS (Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire pour les Cultures Standard, or multidisciplinary simulator for standard crops) model is a dynamic, generic and robust model aiming to simulate the soil-crop-atmosphere system. It was first developed in 1996 by INRA -the French National Institute for Agricultural research-  by Nadine Brisson and Dominique Ripoche. An overview of the model is available [here](https://www6.paca.inra.fr/stics_eng/About-us/Stics-model-overview).

The sticRs package was developed thanks to the European H2020 funded [ReMIX project](https://www.remix-intercrops.eu/).
