# SticsOnR: The R package for the [STICS](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/) model <img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" width="150" align="right" />

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR)
[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR?branch=master)

The goal of SticsOnR is to perform simulations of the Stics model, downloadable with its graphical user interface from https://www6.paca.inra.fr/stics_eng/Download.

<!--## Development 

Follow up the development [here](sticsOnR.md).-->

## Prerequisites and technical tips

### JavaStics software

JavaStics must be installed and the minimal version is version 1.41.

The last distribution version for Stics 9.1, JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1, is downloadable [here](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/Download).

The installation process only constists of unzipping the JavaStics archive.

### Under linux operating systems

#### Java version

For using the JavaStics software (GUI and command line interface) under a `linux` operating system, the java version must be at most the Java 8 version.

So for recent distributions on which a higher version is installed some manipulations can be done. 

A description is given [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsOnR/articles/Changing_java_version_linux.html) on how to fix it for using the R package (i.e. underlying JavaStics command line interface).

#### System libraries
For the linux operating system, the SticsOnR package may require to install an `xslt` library.

If the SticsOnR installation fails, and the `xslt` library is missing, the error message indicates what is the name of the xslt library to be installed (according to the common linux distributions). For example, for the Ubuntu or Debian OS `libxslt1-dev` must be installed.

#### Files/directories paths syntax
Using the `~` in files or directories paths may cause errors in SticsOnR functions.
So, it is safer for the moment to use absolute paths. This will be fixed in the future versions.

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsOnR@*release")
```
Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsOnR@*release")
```
Normaly, all packages dependencies will be installed, either CRAN packages or SticsRPacks 
needed packages. In that case SticsRFiles and CroptimizR will be installed as well.

## Examples

Here are basic examples which show you how to run the model either from a R model interface or a JavaStics (command line) one. More complete examples will be detailed in a specific documentation later.

### Running the JavaStics command line interface

The JavaStics installation folder (for example, JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1) contains an `example` workspace folder with a set of runnable usms.


For running simulations from it, we can use the `run_javastics` function.

In this SticsOnR package, for the moment, only one Stics version can be used with it (i.e. the one delivered with the JavaStics installation archive). JavaStics GUI, allows to manage several Stics executables, but in that case one must take care of consistency between executables version and input files format (advanced use case). 

So, at this point, it is at your own risk if you try to use another version than the JavaStics distribution one.



```{r echo = FALSE}
javastics_path <- params$javastics_path
workspace_path <- params$workspace_path
output_path <- params$output_path
```


```{r run_javastics, eval = FALSE}

# Specifying the JavaStics folder
javastics_path <- "/path/to/JavaSTICS-1.41-stics-9.1"

# Specifying a workspace as a subfolder of JavaStics 
workspace_path <- "example"

# or an absolute path to an external folder
# workspace_path <- "/path/to/javastics/workspace"

```
```{r}

# Running specific usms from the workspace
run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"))

# Running all usms contained in the workspace 
run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path)

# Getting returned information about execution 
runs_info <- run_javastics(javastics_path, workspace_path, usms_list = c("banana","wheat"), display = FALSE)

runs_info

```

In the returned information, the error field name gives a list of messages got from JavaStics commandline interface. If any `Error` key word appears in a message, the corresponding simulation failed. But, at the moment it is impossible to identify what is the error's origin. Things must be checked manually in the workspace, after running again the faulty usm (because the model input files are overwritten at each usms simulation).


<!-- SET eval to TRUE gen_usms_xml2txt has been moved to SticsRFiles -->
```{r, echo=F, results='hide', eval = TRUE}
# Preparing simulation folders for running the model with run_stics
# Generating files for all the usms contained in the workspace
SticsRFiles::gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path,workspace_path =  workspace_path, target_path = output_path )
unlink(x = file.path(output_path, "intercrop_pea_barley"), recursive = T)

```

### Running the model

We need for that a JavaStics folder and a directory with text input files for Stics, or a folder containing usms individual sub-directories .

These directories can be generated using the `gen_usms_xml2txt` function from the **SticsRFiles** package, by converting automatically XML files to Stics input text files. See the documentation [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/articles/Generating_Stics_text_files.html).

Example of use:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Generating files for all the usms contained in the workspace
SticsRFiles::gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path,javastics_workspace_path =  workspace_path, target_path = output_path)
```



The `run_stics` function can be used as follows with one folder or multiple sub-folders.




```{r run_stics}
# Spefifying the Stics executable file path

# for windows
stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path,"bin","stics_modulo.exe")
# for linux
# stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path,"bin","stics_modulo")

# for Mac
# stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path,"bin","stics_modulo_mac")

# Specifying a directory containing Stics input files
# For example reusing a generated sub-directory in the previous section
# of the document
# Running on usm
files_dir_path <- file.path(output_path,"banana")
run_stics(stics_path, files_dir_path)

# Specifying a root directory containing usms individual directories
# For example reusing a generated directory in the previous section
# of the document
# Running two usms
run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = c("banana","wheat"))

# Running all usms sub-directories
run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = "all")

# Getting returned information about stics runs
runs_info <- run_stics(stics_path, output_path, usm_dir_names = c("banana","wheat"))

runs_info

```


### Advanced simulations parameterization 

A specific function `stics_wrapper` is dedicated to manage simulations with a higher level
of parameterization than what `run_stics` offers.

This `stics_wrapper` function allows:

* Forcing the values of a set of parameters (common or specific values per USM)
* Returning simulated daily outputs for each usm with possible dates and variables filtering
* Parallelizing simulations, and displaying execution time

Be aware that for the moment, it **is not possible** to get daily outputs for an `inter-cropping` use case. This will be implemented in future developments.

As the `run_stics` function, the `stics_wrapper` operates on directories 
containing text stics input files.

#### Defining simulations options

Simulation options can be fixed using the `stics_wrapper_options` function. 
Both of them are mandatory: the model executable path and the directory path containing usms sub-directories with text input files.

```{r}
stics_path <- file.path(javastics_path, "bin","stics_modulo")
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path)
```
Optional fields in the `sim_options` list will be detailed later in this document. 

Default values for these optional fields are set by `stics_wrapper_options`. 
They can be displayed by calling the `stics_wrapper_options` function without any argument as follows:
```{r}
stics_wrapper_options()
```

An existing options list may be updated with new values using named arguments as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(in_options = sim_options, parallel = TRUE)
```



#### Simple simulations cases


* Without filtering usms or outputs

```{r}

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```


* Filtering on usms list

```{r}

usms_list <- c("wheat", "pea", "maize")

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = usms_list)

```


* Filtering outputs on usms variables and dates using observations data

The argument `sit_var_dates_mask` must contain a named list (with usms names) containing
data.frames organized as observations data or corresponding to observations data.

```{r}
obs_filenames <- paste0(usms_list,".obs")
obs_list <- get_obs(dirpath = workspace_path, obs_filenames = obs_filenames)

# Observations table for wheat
obs_list$wheat

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = obs_list)

```
Some warnings may occur, indicating that observed variables and/or observations dates are missing in simulated data. 
Concerning the dates, this may be due to the USMs simulation period that may not include observed dates.
For the variables, this may be due to an incorrect spelling of the variables in obs_list or to the list of simulated variables defined in the var.mod file.


#### Simulations with forcing parameters

* Applying a single parameter values vector for all the selected usms 

Parameters values are prescribed using the `param_values` argument. It can be a named vector containing the values and names of the parameters to force.
In this case, the same values will be applied for all the simulated usms.

```{r}

param_values <- c(0.002,50)
names(param_values) <- c("dlaimax", "durvieF")

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, sit_var_dates_mask = usms_list, param_values = param_values)

```

* Defining different parameters values depending on the usms or defining several parameters values per usms

`param_values` can also be a named 3D array containing the value(s) and names of the parameters to force for each situation to simulate. 
This array contains the different parameters values (first dimension) for the different parameters (second dimension) and for the different usms (third dimension). 
By this way, the parameters can take different values depending on the usms. Also, usms can be simulated several times each with different values of the parameters.

```{r}

# Let's run usm wheat with c(dlaimax=0.001, durvieF=50) and c(dlaimax=0.002, durvieF=50),
# usm pea with c(dlaimax=0.001, durvieF=60) and c(dlaimax=0.002, durvieF=60),
# and usm maize with c(dlaimax=0.001, durvieF=70) and c(dlaimax=0.002, durvieF=70)
param_values <- array( c(0.001, 0.002, 50, 50, 
                         0.001, 0.002, 60, 60, 
                         0.001, 0.002, 70, 70),
                      dim=c(2,2,3),
                      dimnames=list(NULL,c("dlaimax", "durvieF"),c("wheat", "pea", "maize")))
                      
# Let's display it
param_values

# In this case, no need to redefine the usms list in sit_var_dates_mask argument, it is already
# given in param_values
results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options, param_values = param_values)

# Let's display the results
head(results)

```

#### Optional arguments

* Displaying execution time

```{r}
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     time_display = TRUE)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```

* Activating parallel execution

On may specify the number of cores to use with the cores argument.

```{r}
sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     parallel =TRUE, time_display = TRUE, cores = 2)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```

If cores is not given, parallel execution is performed over machine total cores number minus 1.

```{r}
# Used cores number
detectCores() - 1

sim_options <- stics_wrapper_options(stics_path = stics_path, data_dir = output_path,
                                     parallel =TRUE, time_display = TRUE)

results <- stics_wrapper(model_options = sim_options)

```
