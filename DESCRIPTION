Description: The purpose of SticsOnR is simply to run simulations with the STICS
    model. It provides three different ways to perform a simulation depending on
    the use-case: 1/ Call JavaStics to run a simulation on a given situation. In
    this case JavaStics will handle the generation of the text files from the 
    XML files; 2/ Call the STICS model executable directly. In this case the 
    text files should be produced beforehand; and 3/ Call the STICS model 
    executable through a wrapper that handles distributed runs over the machine
    CPUs and returns the simulated values to the user. The wrapper also provides
    a concise manner for making a simulation custom parameters values.
