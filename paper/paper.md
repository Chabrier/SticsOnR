# Summary

Crop models are often written in programming languages with relatively low-level of abstraction such as ``FORTRAN`` or ``C`` because they are well-suited for scientific calculation. However, higher-level tasks such as programmatic model parameterization, data manipulation (*e.g.* import/export of measurements and model outputs, statistics, plots), distributed computation or sensitivity analyses are often not integrated into the model, making their evaluation and application more complicated than it has to be. Hence, developers tend to design modelling environments for that purpose using different tools such as java applications, Python modules or R packages.

The STICS model [@Brisson:2008] is a dynamic, generic and robust model to simulate the soil-crop-atmosphere system. It has been developed for more than twenty years [@brisson1998stics] by more than 50 authors, and is now used by hundreds of users (1100 downloads as of 2012) across academic field (*e.g.* INRA, CIRAD, IRSTEA, more than 230 international papers), government agencies and technical institutions (Arvalis, French chamber of agriculture), international projects (H2020 ReMIX, agMIP), and schools (SupAgro). Hence, developing a complex model with as many users implies a thorough and careful development, while remaining easy to parameterize and use.

Excluding meteorological data, the STICS model needs more than 300 parameters for sole crops. These parameters are not always easily measurable on the field, measured with high variability, or simply not readily available to the user [@tremblay2004comparison; @launay2005assimilating]. Hence, a user should always evaluate the model sensitivity to the parameters before setting an approximated value [@VARELLA2010310].
The model has also different options for some formalisms (*e.g.* light interception), and the user should evaluate which is better suited for his particular use case either by making a guess, or better, by comparing the model outputs with different options.

A developer that modifies a new formalism or designing a new one should also evaluate its impact on the model outputs, and make a systematic comparison between different model versions or parameterization along field observations.

Therefore, STICS users and developers often experience the same different steps in their journey:

* Read, write or add parameters and their values
* Test the model programmatically for different parameter values, formalisms or model versions
* Evaluate the model against field observations
* Make plots
* Make a sensitivity analysis
* Distribute the runs across multiple cores / machines

``sticRs`` is an R package that was designed to make these steps as easy and fast as possible, and more importantly, reproducible. It has been adapted for the regular sole crop version of STICS, but also to its intercrop version [@CORREHELLOU200972].
The following diagram presents a typical workflow using the main functions from ``sticRs``: ![sticRs workflow](sticRs_workflow.png)

Evaluating the model is so fast and straightforward using ``sticRs`` that it is often bypassed to directly evaluate STICS using the ``stics_eval`` function, which is a wrapper of all previous functions and more. The package also automatically distributes the simulations across computer cores when the user call ``stics_eval`` and  ``sensitive_stics``.

``sticRs`` documentation is accessible on its dedicated website (https://vezy.github.io/sticRs), and its source code has been archived to Zenodo with a concept (*i.e.* permanent) DOI [@zenodo].
